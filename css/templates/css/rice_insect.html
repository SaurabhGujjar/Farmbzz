            <p class="asx"> Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa(Asian rice) or Oryza glaberrima(African rice).
                It is a <br/>cereal grain belongs to the grass family of Graminae and native to the deltas of the great Asian rivers,<br/>
                 the Ganges, the Chang (Yangtze), and the Tigris and Euphrates. The rice plant grows from 2 to 6 ft tall,<br/> with a
                  round, jointed stem, long pointed leaves and edible seeds borne in dense head  separate stalks.<br/> Rice is one 
                  of the most cultivated grain crops in India as well as in Asian countries and a staple diet of major part of 
                  India. India is an important centre for the rice cultivation and consumption. India stands in<br/> second position after
                  China  the production of rice. Major rice producing state are Haryana ,Tamil Nadu, West Bengal , Uttar Pradesh 
                  , Andhra Pradesh . Methods  growing rice differ greatly in different regions, <br/>but in most Asian countries 
                  including India, the traditional hand methods of cultivating and harvesting<br/> rice are still practiced.Modern 
                  farming of rice started in most of the countries which drastically reduced<br/> the labour problems and the cost of cultivation.
                   There are machines available from planting  harvesting<br/> the rice crop. Some parts of Indian rural areas still depend 
                   on the wet buffalos for land preparation and manpower in plantation and harvesting. People often confuses with paddy 
                   and rice. Rice when it is still covered by the brown hull is known as paddy. Rice fields are also called paddy fields or rice paddies.

                            source, and weeds, animal pests and pathogens are regularly of economic importance despite regional differences. In India, the overall yield
                            losses in rice due to insect pests were estimated to be around 37.4 (2003). As per the data available the yield loss due to animal pest were
                            estimated to be around 15.1%(2001-2003). As per the data available the yield loss due to weeds were estimated to be around 10.2%

These burrows are usually limited by the leaf veins and contain black fecal material visible as slim trace inside the tunnels. Entire leaves may be covered with mines. Damaged leaves may drop prematurely (defoliation). Defoliation can reduce yield and fruit size and expose fruit to sunburn.

                               <h3> <b>Triger:</b></h3><p class="text">   Symptoms are cause by several flies belonging to the family of the Agromyzidae, with  several thousand species worldwide. In spring, females puncture leaf tissues and lay their eggs, usually along the margins. The larvae feed between the upper and the lower leaf surface. They produce large white meandering tunnels with a trail of black fecal material (frass) left behind as they feed. Once they have reached maturity, larvae open a hole on teh underside of the leaf and fall to the ground, where they pupate. Plant debris near the host are alternative pupating places.

                               <h3> <b>Biological method:</b></h3><p class="text"> 
                                    Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Broad-spectrum insecticides of the organophosphates, carbamates and pyrethroids families prevent adults from laying eggs, but they do not kill the larvae. Moreover, they can lead to the decrease of natural enemies and the development of resistance in the fly, which in some cases can actually result in an increase in their numbers. Products such as abamectin, bifenthrin, methoxyfenozide, chlorantraniliprole or spinetoram can be used in a rotation to avoid development of resistance.</p>
                           <h3><b>Chemical method:</b></h3><p class="text">
                               
              Minor infestation just leads to cosmetic damage and does not affect productivity. Parasitic wasps that kill leaf-miner larvae in the mine are commercially available. Ladybirds are also predators of the leaf miner fly. Neem oil,  Neem Seed Kernal Extract (NSKE 5%), Neem oil (15000 ppm) @ 5ml/l or Spinosad deter adults from feeding and reduce egg laying, thus limiting damage. These products have a low impact on natural enemies and pollinators.

                           <h3><b>Prevention:</b></h3><p class="text">
                                Plant seedlings free of eggs of leafminer flies. Choose varieties with curled leaves that are less susceptible to the pest. Avoid planting alternative hosts next to infested fields. Monitor fields for signs of the insect on leaves. Use yellow sticky traps or yellow basins filled with water to catch the flies. Handpick and destroy mined leaves or heavily-infested plants. Plant hedge rows of flowering plants to prevent migration of the fly. Remove weeds and volunteer plants in and around the fields. Apply mulch around plants to prevent the flies from breeding in the soil. Do not use broad-spectrum insecticide that could affect natural enemies. Plow deep to expose the miners to natural enemies. Alternatively, burn infected plant debris after harvest. Rotate crops with non-susceptible crops.

                            The young P. stagnalis larva causes linear grazing of leaves. Rice case worms cut off rice leaves tips at right angles to make leaf cases. Caseworm damage is characterized by leaves cut at right angles as with a pair of scissors and leaf cases floating on water. Larvae feed by scraping the leaf tissue, leaving the papery upper layer of the leaf. Leaves that were fed upon are also left with a ladder-like structures of hard fibers. Damage symptoms can be confused with other defoliating insect pests. To confirm caseworm, visually inspect: first, the ladder-like leaf tissues; second, cut leaves; and third, the presence of leaf cases attached onto leaf sheaths and floating in the water.

                                The insect is most likely to be found in rice fields with standing water, in both wetland and irrigated environments. It survives on weeds and weedy rice in the field and nearby areas and infect new rice crops when the conditions are favorable. Transplanting young seedlings also favors the development of the insect. Poor preparatory cultivation and soils having deficiency in Zinc will predispose the crop to this disease. However, despite all of this, the insect is commonly found in rice fields in low populations.

                            Feeding damage at the base of the plant or along the central stem causes dead tillers at the vegetative stages ('deadhearts') and whitish unfilled panicles ('whiteheads') at the reproductive stages. After hatching, the larvae bore into the leaf sheath and feed on the inner surface of the stem. Tiny holes, frass and fecal matter can be observed on the damaged plant tissues. The larvae can move from one internode to another. During the vegetative stage, larval feeding may not cause visible symptoms because the plant compensates for the damage by producing extra tillers. But, this costs energy and ultimately yield will be affected.</p>
                           <h3> <b>Triger:</b></h3><p class="text">
                                The damage is caused by the larvae of the yellow stem borer, Scirpophaga incertulas, a pest of deepwater rice. It is found in plants or leaf-over stubbles in aquatic environments where there is continuous flooding. Young larvae wrap part of a leaf around their body and detach themselves from the plant, falling onto the water surface. They then attach themselves to the base of  a new plant and bore into the stem. High nitrogenous field are highly favorable. Fields planted later in the season also favor the insect, whose population has built up in fields that have been planted earlier. As a comparison, the pest can cause about 20% yield loss in early planted rice, and 80% in late-planted crops.</p>
                           <h3> <b>Biological method:</b></h3><p class="text"> 
                                Treatments include the application of products containing bacteria and fungi that affect the larvae (before it penetrate the stem). Neem extracts can also be used for that purpose (15 ml/L of water). Light traps can also be set up to attract the moths. Use pheromone traps or mass traps from 15 days after transplanting (@ 3/acre or @ 8/acre, respectively). Replace on 25, 46 and 57 days after transplanting. Finally, five to six releases of the egg parasitoid Trichogramma japonicum (100,000/ha) starting from 15 days after planting can be planned. Natural predators and parasitoids are numerous and include several species of ants, beetles, grasshoppers, flies, wasps, nematodes, mites, earwigs, birdsdragonflies, damselflies and spiders.

                            Look for varieties that are resistant to this pest. Plant early in the season to avoid the worst damage. Synchronize planting with neighboring farmers. Before transplanting, cut the leaf-top to reduce carry-over of eggs. Avoid planting seedlings too close to each other. Monitor the seedbeds and fields regularly. Handpick and destroy egg masses in seedbeds and during transplanting. Control weeds and volunteer plants in and around the field. Pull out and destroy affected plants. Make a moderate use of nitrogenous fertilizers or manures. Apply the fertilizers in split applications during the season. Raise level of irrigation water periodically to kill the eggs. Do not use broad-spectrum insecticides to fight pests. Harvest the crops at ground level to remove the larvae in stubble. Remove stubbles, plant debris and destroy them after harvest. Plow and flood the field after harvest to drown remaining larvae.

                   <p class="text">Parasitization with platygasterid, eupelmid, and pteromalid wasps (parasitize the larvae), phytoseiid mites (feed on eggs), spiders (feed on adults) have successfully been used. Planting more flowering plant that attract the insects around the rice field also helps.
                    </p>
                         <h3><b>Prevention:</b></h3>
                                     <p class="text">

              Use resistant varieties available locally.,Plant early, at the beginning of the rainy season.,Use a wider space between plants or a looser sowing rate.,Plant trap plants that attract beneficial insects around the rice fields.,Remove all off-season plant hosts around the rice field.,Check the optimum recommendation of nitrogen and potash fertilizer.,Use light traps along with sticky board with oil or glue to collect the moths.,Plow plant debris of the previous crop immediately after harvest.,Keep land fallow some weeks or months during off season.
