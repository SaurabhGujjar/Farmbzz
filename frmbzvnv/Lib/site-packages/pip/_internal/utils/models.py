 An int, number of trees to build.
      feature_columns: A list of feature columns.
      weight_column_name: Name of the column for weights, or None if not
        weighted.
      model_dir: Directory for model exports, etc.
      config: `RunConfig` object to configure the runtime settings.
      feature_engineering_fn: Feature engineering function. Takes features and
        labels which are the output of `input_fn` and returns features and
        labels which will be fed into the model.
      logits_modifier_function: A modifier function for the logits.
      center_bias: Whether a separate tree should be created for first fitting
        the bias.
      use_core_libs: Whether feature columns and loss are from the core (as
        opposed to contrib) version of tensorflow.
      output_leaf_index: whether to output leaf indices along with predictions
        during inference. The leaf node indexes are available in predictions
        dict by the key 'leaf_index'. For example,
        result_dict = classifier.predict(...)
